# Stat360-Topic-Modeling
Topic Modeling for the Democratic Debates

This project was undertaken by Meredith Brown and Caleb Kornfein as their final project for Statistics 360: Bayesian and Modern Statistics.

Modeling text data from the 2019-2020 Democratic Debates, this project used LDA topic modeling to analyze which topics occur most frequently and by which candidate.
